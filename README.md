# Features
- Over 100 new recipes, ranging from snacks to feasts
- 7 new crops that can be found throughout the world
- An in-game cookbook that updates as you pick up ingredients and unlock recipes
- New interactive cooking blocks to let you chop, mix and cook your way to culinary excellence
- A wine aging system, with unique effects that increase in potency the longer a wine is aged
- An advancement tab to help guide you through the pack
- A fully [data-driven backend](https://github.com/maybejake/crop-and-kettle/wiki/Addons), allowing other datapacks to easily add their own recipes and cookbook pages!
- New music, new tools, _secrets_, and so much more!

Crop & Kettle is designed to be figured out by playing it, using the advancement tab and cookbook to figure out recipes and what to do next! But if you're stuck, or just want more detail on what the pack offers, then checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/maybejake/crop-and-kettle/wiki)!

# FAQ
### Where is the resource pack?
It's packaged with the datapack! The zip file you download can be used interchangeably, so just drop it into your resourcepack and datapack folders and you'll be good to go!
### How do I get the cookbook?
Craft it using wheat and a book in a crafting table, but the recipe is unlocked for you by default. Search for "The Craft of Cooking"
### Where can I find the seeds for the new crops?
Check the cookbook!
### Where can I find the food recipes?
In the cookbook!
### I hate the discovery system, how can I unlock all the recipes in the cookbook?
Crop & Kettle has a settings page! Press escape, then click:

`Datapacks...` > `Crop & Kettle` > `Settings` > `Unlock Cookbook`
### How can I get rid of the white box that pops up when I turn pages in the cookbook?
This is sadly an annoying side effect of how Mojang made dialogs work. I'm hoping it will be fixed in a later version, but for now you can remove it by downloading the [unjank](https://modrinth.com/mod/unjank) mod!
### Will you port to version 1.X.X?
The answer will always be "if I have time". However, Crop & Kettle is made using a lot of features (dialogs, etc...) that were added in 1.21.6, hence it being the earliest version its currently available on. But who knows what the future holds!
### How do I make an addon/add compatibility to my datapack?
Glad you asked! Checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/maybejake/crop-and-kettle/wiki/Addons), it has a guide on how to do add recipes and cookbook pages, as well as an example addon!
### Why can't I see the items in the creative menu or in REI/JEI/NEI?
This is a datapack that has been packaged as a mod for convenience of installation. It is currently not possible for custom items added by datapacks to be added to the creative menu or detected by any REI-like mod.
